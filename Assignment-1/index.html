            <h3>My Tech Journey üßë‚Äçüíª</h3>
                <article>
                    I was first introduced with programming when I was in 8th standard and we learned html in school, after that I learned C++ in school also
                    which was the time I got interested in programming and knew that I had to do something in it. After that I started learning Java on my own
                    and it gave me a very good base to learn programming. I also learned about different Data structures using Java like Ararys, Linked Lists, Trees etc.
                    But then I got a bit bored with Programming and stopped for some time and explored different IT fields I can specialise in, that is when I 
                    found out my love for Frontend Development, then I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript and React and luckily got my first full time job as a frontend developer.
                    I really enjoy the creative thinking in Frontend and solving complex UI problems is something I find very fun. You can say a lot about my social life if I
                    am describing UI problems as fun üòÖ.

            <h3>My Travels üíº</h3>
                <article>
                    Travelling to different places is something I really enjoy. While I was studying and working in India I used to travel a lot, like 
                    almost 2-3 trips every year. I had some goof friends and we used to plan trips together in different states in India. I went to Rishikesh 
                    with my friends which was probably my best trip till date, Rishikesh is a hill station in Northern India, I was really mesmerised by 
                    the beauty of mountains and rivers flowing through them. Then my first International trip was Pattaya, Thailand, i went there as a part of my 
                    annual office trip, I saw a very different and vibrant culture from my own. It was first time I got to know that learning English is not 
                    good enough to travel the world ü•≤. But I really enjoyed that experience and I would definately like to travel there again.
